# AERSP424HW02

This is the second homework for Penn State AERSP 424: Advanced Computer Programming - Fall 2023.

Here I develop a graphical interface simulator for an air traffic management system of the University Park Airport. 
The repository is distributed as follows:

- The include directory has two subfolders:
    - TrafficControl: this folder contains the classes' definitions and implementations for questions 1 to 4 and 6.
    - Visualization: this folder contains HW2_VIZ class definition Prof. Khamvilai gave us for SDL graphical development.
- the resources folder contains the map.
- src folder has the main.cpp and the implementation of HW2_VIZ class which is used in the executable that runs question 8.
- tests folder accounts for question 5 and 7, each of those has its own executable.
